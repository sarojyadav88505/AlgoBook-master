1. Start
2. Accept the no of processes that must be scheduled as n.
3. For each of the processes, assign the process ID and accept the priority numbers and the burst time of each process.
4. Now, sort the queue of processes according to the priority numbers.(such that the highest priority job comes first and lowest priority job comes last)
5. The waiting time of first process in the queue is 0 and its turn-around time is its burst time.(Set the values as such)
6. For each process in the ready queue, calculate

	a) Waiting Time of process(i) = Waiting time of process(i-1) + Burst Time of process(i-1)
	
	b) Turn-Around Time of process(i) = Waiting time of process(i) + Burst time of process(i)

7. Now, atlast calculate
	
	a) Average Waiting Time = Sum of waiting times of all the processes / No of processes(n)

	b) Average Turn-Around Time = Sum of Turn-Around Times of all processes / No of processes(n)
